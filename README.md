# ADA-Project-

How to Run the Project :

This repository contains the final notebook for the ADA Capstone Project.
All input datasets (.xlsx files) are provided directly at the root of the repository, at the same level as the notebook.

The repository must be kept unchanged after cloning or downloading:
Final Capstone Project ADA.ipynb — main notebook
sp500.xlsx, MSCI.xlsx, ishares.xlsx, vix.xlsx, stoxx.xlsx, HFRXGL Index.xlsx — input dataset

⚠️ The Excel files must remain in the repository root and must not be moved.


Instructions : 

Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.
Open the repository folder.
Open Final Capstone Project ADA.ipynb from the repository root.
Run all cells from top to bottom.
No additional configuration or path modification is required.

The notebook uses relative paths and assumes execution from the repository root directory.
As long as the original repository structure is preserved, the code will run correctly on any system.
